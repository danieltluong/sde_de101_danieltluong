Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; where would you start? 
-Figure out the ETL process the company uses
-Figure out the modeling techniques, frameworks, and warehouses used

How would you go about gathering requirements?
-I would speak to the data team and ask about the current land of the land
-I would ask stakeholders, analysts, and other users what they are using the data for and want to get out of it
-I would explore the data warehouses on my own to figure out what I like and dislike, and what can be modified
